Assignment 3 Hyperparameter tuning for random forest, decision tree and SVC


Comparison of results
Baseline Random Forest:77.7777
Tuned Random Forest: 82.63
Baseline Decision Tree (gini index):66.66
Baseline Decision Tree (Entropy):69.64
Tuned Decision Tree:71.52 using Gini
Baseline SVC:80.952
Tuned SVC:84.02
SVC seems to give the best result for classification.
